      <h2>Mental Disorders</h2>
      <p>
        A mental disorder is characterized by a clinically significant disturbance in an individual’s cognition,
        emotional regulation, or behaviour. It is usually associated with distress or impairment in important areas of
        functioning. There are many different types of mental disorders. Mental disorders may also be referred to as
        mental health conditions. The latter is a broader term covering mental disorders, psychosocial disabilities and
        (other) mental states associated with significant distress, impairment in functioning, or risk of self-harm.
        This fact sheet focuses on mental disorders as described by the International Classification of Diseases 11th
        Revision (ICD-11).
        In 2019, 1 in every 8 people, or 970 million people around the world were living with a mental disorder, with
        anxiety and depressive disorders the most common (1). In 2020, the number of people living with anxiety and
        depressive disorders rose significantly because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Initial estimates show a 26% and 28%
        increase respectively for anxiety and major depressive disorders in just one year (2). While effective
        prevention and treatment options exist, most people with mental disorders do not have access to effective care.
        Many people also experience stigma, discrimination and violations of human rights.</p>

      <h2>Anxiety Disorders</h2>
      <p>In 2019, 301 million people were living with an anxiety disorder including 58 million children and adolescents
        (1). Anxiety disorders are characterised by excessive fear and worry and related behavioural disturbances.
        Symptoms are severe enough to result in significant distress or significant impairment in functioning. There are
        several different kinds of anxiety disorders, such as: generalised anxiety disorder (characterised by excessive
        worry), panic disorder (characterised by panic attacks), social anxiety disorder (characterised by excessive
        fear and worry in social situations), separation anxiety disorder (characterised by excessive fear or anxiety
        about separation from those individuals to whom the person has a deep emotional bond), and others. Effective
        psychological treatment exists, and depending on the age and severity, medication may also be considered.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>Depression</h2>
      <p>

        In 2019, 280 million people were living with depression, including 23 million children and adolescents (1).
        Depression is different from usual mood fluctuations and short-lived emotional responses to challenges in
        everyday life. During a
        depressive episode, the person experiences depressed mood (feeling sad, irritable, empty) or a loss of pleasure
        or interest in activities, for most of the day, nearly every day, for at least two weeks. Several other symptoms
        are also present, which may include poor concentration, feelings of excessive guilt or low self-worth,
        hopelessness about the future, thoughts about dying or suicide, disrupted sleep, changes in appetite or weight,
        and feeling especially tired or low in energy. People with depression are at an increased risk of suicide. Yet,
        effective psychological treatment exists, and depending on the age and severity, medication may also be
        considered.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>Bipolar Disorder</h2>
      <p>
        In 2019, 40 million people experienced bipolar disorder (1). People with bipolar disorder experience alternating
        depressive episodes with periods of manic symptoms. During a depressive episode, the person experiences
        depressed mood (feeling sad, irritable, empty) or a loss of pleasure or interest in activities, for most of the
        day, nearly every day. Manic symptoms may include euphoria or irritability, increased activity or energy, and
        other symptoms such as increased talkativeness, racing thoughts, increased self-esteem, decreased need for
        sleep, distractibility, and impulsive reckless behaviour. People with bipolar disorder are at an increased risk
        of suicide. Yet effective treatment options exist including psychoeducation, reduction of stress and
        strengthening of social functioning, and medication.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</h2>
      <p>The prevalence of PTSD and other mental disorders is high in conflict-affected settings (3). PTSD may develop
        following exposure to an extremely threatening or horrific event or series of events. It is characterised by all
        of the following: 1) re-experiencing the traumatic event or events in the present (intrusive memories,
        flashbacks, or nightmares); 2) avoidance of thoughts and memories of the event(s), or avoidance of activities,
        situations, or people reminiscent of the event(s); and 3) persistent perceptions of heightened current threat.
        These symptoms persist for at least several weeks and cause significant impairment in functioning. Effective
        psychological treatment exists.</p>
